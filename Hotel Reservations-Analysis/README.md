## 🏨 Hotel Data Analysis Project

This project contains a simple data-cleaning and analytics workflow for hotel dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## 📘 Project Overview

This project explores a hotel dataset to identify trends and patterns. The notebook includes:
- Loading and exploring the raw dataset
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data
- Visualizing the cleaned data
- Extracting insights from patterns and trends<br>
The aim is to demonstrate a simple and effective data-analysis workflow.

## 📊 Data Visualization Summary

The project uses two main Python libraries for visualization:
- Matplotlib – Creates basic charts like bar graphs, line charts, and pie charts. It is used for customizing titles, labels, and figure sizes.
- Seaborn – Builds on Matplotlib and makes it easier to create clean, attractive graphs such as count plots, histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps. <br>
Together, these libraries help visualize booking trends, customer behavior, and important patterns in the hotel dataset.

## 📘 Jupyter Notebook & Analysis Outputs

The complete analysis workflow—including preprocessing steps, exploratory insights, and all visualization results—is fully documented in the Jupyter Notebook linked below:
